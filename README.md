# Biased Coin Analysis

## Overview

This project is a game designed to detect whether a coin is fair or biased (cheating). The goal is to identify a cheater or confirm a fair coin using the minimum number of coin flips. The game ends when the player runs out of flips. The game also highlights the trade-offs between data accuracy and the cost of data collection, making it a practical demonstration of statistical decision-making.

### Task

The task is to determine if a coin is fair or biased (cheating). A fair coin has an equal probability of landing heads or tails, while a biased coin favors one outcome more frequently. The objective is to use the smallest number of flips to make this determination and maximize the score based on correct guesses.
